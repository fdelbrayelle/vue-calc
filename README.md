# vue-calc

## Exercise description

The goal of this exercise is to develop a simple calculator with Vue 2. The interface has to be simpliest as possible.

Here are the specifications that need to be implemented:
- As a user I want to type simple operations (addition, substraction, multiplication, division) in an input text at the top in order to see results.
- As a user I want to type simple operations by using digits buttons to type my numbers in order to see them in the input text at the top.
- As a user I want to choose my operation with buttons "+", "-", "*" and "/" in order to see results in the input text at the top.
- As a user I want to see the result of my operation with an "=" button in order to see results in the input text at the top.
- As a user I want there is some control on what I type or select with buttons in order to ensure there is no error (for instance I cannot type or select "42+*").
- ...

:warning: Don't forget to install Vue CLI with `npm install -g @vue/cli` and to open your favourite IDE if it's not done yet!

Good luck!
